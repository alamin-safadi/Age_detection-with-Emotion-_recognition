# Real-Time Face Detection with Age and Emotion Analysis

This project uses **OpenCV** and **DeepFace** to detect faces from a webcam feed in real-time and analyze each face for **age** and **dominant emotion**.

## Features

-  Real-time face detection from webcam
-  Age and emotion prediction using Deep Learning
-  Displays face count, age, and emotion on screen
-  Uses Haar Cascade for face detection

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- DeepFace (built on TensorFlow/Keras)
- Haar Cascade Classifier

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python deepface
